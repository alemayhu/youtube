A static website to list my YouTube channels.

This project was created to for experimenting with Tailwind CSS.

I ended up using Svelte for convenience since I found a project template already wired up and ready to use.

This project was bootstraped with https://github.com/muhajirdev/svelte-tailwind-template
## Get started

```bash
yarn # npm install
yarn dev # npm run dev
```

Navigate to [localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000). You should see the site running. Edit a  file in `src`, save it, and voil√† the page reloads to show
you the changes.
